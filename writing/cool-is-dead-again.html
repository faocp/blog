            <h2>Cool is dead. Again.</h2>
            <p class="essay-meta">February 2026 · #thoughts #internet</p>

            <p>
                I have been thinking more about the explosion of the attention economy and the decadence of cool. Cited in the excellent <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-only-taboo-left-is-copyright-infringement?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-only-taboo-left-is-copyright-infringement&_bhlid=2772173498d5c57575847fc1cc26fab8c87febf1">Garbage Day</a> newsletter, I see this quote:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    As <em>The New York Times</em>' Jon Caramanica said recently (on a <a href="https://elink835.www.garbageday.email/ss/c/u001._-qCIiYyp6dD21H99lwa0n1icVwMck_Ei3CEjAe3q1pFYy68YMZIUV3jv-5L-Ur3dqqrMeDcBJ9PwTerTXAvsbWUOxVXmT8MKGfblTqc9eykYCgC6CLX9eova6rJucFiNNC5YNFY7JZeO321whRUSywjMiuPrKUfHdvwnY1nJm8SQVD6l15rcQN-k-FV8JqMntLUvZOSk7eJL-nFuAboO4V4Vp3XcSVhOXAGVWY5Dvg_P9mpDXHvlET4k8aYcpEMpxJQHcitbrRhUJQIemFzEGkPsgH5pWw/4o9/5xp9Owf_QBm8Dp7eDb3yoQ/h4/h001.PHMy3f2Oqj5Qa4ZJgXTDVWY2x8gcWB6e4EsKyyaYyLk">livestream</a>, it should be noted), "The gap between 'I'm a comedian,' 'I'm a content creator,' 'I'm a musician' — we used to think of those as three different jobs. They're not three different jobs anymore. It's basically just one job, which is getting attention. That's the main job."
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                There's nothing cool anymore if the pre-requisite for cool is attention. If the job is getting attention, there's no incentive to like something obscure or niche and dreaming up some slow and difficult, but passionate, way of bringing it to more people. The <em>lag</em> between obscurity and visibility has collapsed, and that lag was doing a lot of the cultural work. The delay was generative — it created subcultures, mystique, scarcity of access.
            </p>

            <p>
                Taste is so fleeting that by the time you are able to socialize your idea of cool to the masses, a thousand other trends have already capitalized people's attention, and your idea of cool, at best, will see some short virality, and go where all the memes go to die, within a week. If Nirvana was born in the 2020's it would quite literally be a TikTok band with one or two 20-second viral clips, and this is assuming the label got a 19 year-old <em>hype consultant</em> in the room with Kurt.
            </p>

            <p>
                The algorithmic incentive, which in our near past was to (1) be provocative in all the wrong ways or (2) do something nasty to capture eyeballs, is once again shifting, since, if <strong>everyone</strong> is nasty and provocative, that no longer meets the threshold for earning attention.
            </p>

            <p>
                What's also been funny to me is that these dynamics have been mostly contained to the internet, but are more and more spilling out to real life in form of teen productivity/work hustle tiktokers — the kind that you'd see on Linkedin sharing how their "SaaS earned 100M in a week by following these 3 simple rules" — being hired in <em>actual</em> companies, to do <em>actual</em> work, simply because the CTO took note of their online popularity, and wants the company to be associated with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, with AI this will become exacerbated, as it more and more trivializes <em>traditional skills</em> (think of coding, for example), and does not change the demand for attention, which continues to bring economic value. But I digress, perhaps one day my "How online clout is bleeding into institutional legitimacy" essay will hit this website.
